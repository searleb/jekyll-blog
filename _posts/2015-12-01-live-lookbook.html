   <h4>The Brief</h4>

   <p>The brief had four key objectives:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         Providing a unique selling point for LIVE amongst competition.
      </li>
      <li>
         Increasing the brand’s appeal to a broader audience (a more trend-focussed consumer) while still satisfying the needs of the current users.
      </li>
      <li>
         Inspiring consumers to frequently colour their hair and get creative.
      </li>
      <li>
         Provide a valuable experience for consumers, encouraging repeat engagements with an owned brand platform.
      </li>
   </ul>
