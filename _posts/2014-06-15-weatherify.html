    <p>Weatherify takes your local weather conditions and creates a Spotify playlist based on that information.</p>
    <p>For example, if your summary is 'Partly Cloudy', Weatherify will create a playlist of tracks containing 'cloudy' in their title.</p>

        <small>Unfortunely the app has crashed on Heroku and I haven't had time to investigate why.</small>
