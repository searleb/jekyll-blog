   <p>
      This application was built for a musician friend of mine who wanted a better way of organising and searching his business contacts.
      <br>
      The app takes entries with searchable custom fields and the one search bar will search across all. So querying a name, skill, location, number etc will all return results
   </p>
   <p>
      Built with Ionic/Angular and Firebase <small><small>but never really completed :(</small></small>
